## About Me

My name is Trevor Maggart. I was born in Bad Soden, Germany, but was raised in Tokyo, Japan from the age of 6 to 18. Below you can view an image of where I grew up in Tokyo.

## Currently

I am a student at [Macalester College](www.macalester.edu), and I have yet to declare my major. Music is one of my greatest passions, but I am not much of a fan for the requirements to be a music major. For this reason I'm currently leaning towards either Computer Science or Geology as my prospective major.

## Previously

I attended high school at [The American School in Japan](www.asij.ac.jp) located in Chofu, Tokyo. The American School In Japan is a private school located in Japan and is tailored for international kids living overseas. For this reason there are a lot of military kids and children of expats that attend this school. 

## Interests

  * I run XC
  * I run Track
  
* I like music

  * I play piano (although I would like to improve)
